# Introduction to RAG and Techniques: Exploration with Frameworks

## Project Overview

This project explores Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques and frameworks.  It provides an introduction to RAG and demonstrates basic usage.  The project includes a Jupyter Notebook showcasing basic RAG implementation and accompanying slides for a presentation.

## Features

* **Basic RAG Implementation:** A Jupyter Notebook (`speaking_on_your_behalf_basic_rag.ipynb`) demonstrating a fundamental RAG workflow.
* **Presentation Slides:** A PDF file (`slides/Introduction-RAG-Techniques-Frameworks.pdf`) containing introductory material on RAG, techniques, and frameworks.


## Installation

This project primarily utilizes Python.  To setup the environment, we recommend using `conda` (if available in your environment).  Ensure you have `conda` installed.  If not, please refer to the conda documentation for installation instructions [https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html).

While no explicit environment file (e.g., `environment.yml`) is provided, you can create a conda environment suitable for running the notebook as follows:

1. **Create the environment:**
   ```bash
   conda create -n rag_intro python=3.9  # Adjust python version as needed
   conda activate rag_intro
   ```

2. **Install necessary packages:**  The exact packages required will depend on the `speaking_on_your_behalf_basic_rag.ipynb` notebook. Install packages based on the notebook's import statements. For example:

   ```bash
   conda install -c conda-forge <package_name1> <package_name2> ...
   pip install <package_name3> <package_name4> ...
   ```

   Replace `<package_name1>`, `<package_name2>`, etc., with the specific packages imported in the notebook.


## Usage

1. **Activate the conda environment:**
   ```bash
   conda activate rag_intro
   ```

2. **Launch Jupyter Notebook:**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook speaking_on_your_behalf_basic_rag.ipynb
   ```

3. **Follow the instructions in the notebook:** The notebook provides a step-by-step guide to understanding and running a basic RAG example.

4. **Review the presentation slides:** Open the `slides/Introduction-RAG-Techniques-Frameworks.pdf` file for a more comprehensive overview.

This README will be updated as the project evolves and includes more detailed dependency information.
