# NLP Meets GenAI LLMs & RAG: Speaking on Your Behalf (Basic RAG)

## Project Overview

This project explores the intersection of Natural Language Processing (NLP), Generative AI (GenAI) Large Language Models (LLMs), and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).  Specifically, it focuses on building a basic RAG system capable of "speaking on your behalf" by leveraging external knowledge. The project includes a Jupyter Notebook demonstrating core functionalities and accompanying presentation slides.


## Features

* **Basic RAG Implementation:**  A functional implementation of a Retrieval Augmented Generation system.
* **Jupyter Notebook Walkthrough:** A detailed Jupyter Notebook (`speaking_on_your_behalf_basic_rag.ipynb`) guiding users through the project's core concepts and implementation.
* **Presentation Slides:**  Presentation slides (`slides/nlp_meets_genai_llms_rag.pdf`) summarizing the project's goals, methods, and results.


## Installation

This project utilizes Python.  To set up the environment, it's recommended to use `conda` (though `pip` could also be used; adapt the installation steps as needed if `conda` is not available):

1. **Create a conda environment:**
   ```bash
   conda create -n nlp_rag python=3.9 # Adjust python version as needed
   conda activate nlp_rag
   ```

2. **(If a `requirements.txt` file exists, install dependencies):**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```



## Usage

1. **Activate your conda environment:**
   ```bash
   conda activate nlp_rag
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd nlp_meets_genai_llms_rag
   ```

3. **Launch Jupyter Notebook:**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook speaking_on_your_behalf_basic_rag.ipynb
   ```

4. **Follow the instructions in the Jupyter Notebook to run the code and explore the RAG implementation.**  You may need to adjust file paths within the notebook to reflect your local setup.
