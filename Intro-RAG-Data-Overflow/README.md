# Intro to Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Data Overflow

## Overview
This project provides an introduction to Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) through a Jupyter Notebook and an accompanying presentation. It demonstrates a basic RAG data flow, illustrating how retrieval-based augmentation enhances generative models.

## Features
- **Jupyter Notebook (`basic_rag_dataflow.ipynb`)**: A hands-on demonstration of RAG data flow with step-by-step explanations.
- **Presentation Slides (`slides/Introduction to RAG.pdf`)**: A conceptual overview of RAG, explaining key principles and benefits.
- **Google Colab Support**: Run the notebook directly in Google Colab without local installation. [Open Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) and then upload this notebook.

## Installation
This project requires Python and some essential libraries. you can install dependencies manually within the notebook itself.

### **Step-by-step setup:**
1. **Install Python** (if not already installed) from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
2. **Install Jupyter Notebook** by running:
   ```sh
   pip install jupyter
   ```
3. **Install dependencies** (inspect `basic_rag_dataflow.ipynb` for required packages). Common ones include:
   ```sh
   pip install pandas langchain langchain-groq
   ```

## Usage
### **Local Execution**
1. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```sh
   cd Intro-RAG-Data-Overflow
   ```
2. **Start Jupyter Notebook**:
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook
   ```
3. **Open and run the notebook**: In the Jupyter interface, open `basic_rag_dataflow.ipynb` and execute the cells sequentially.
4. **View the slides**: Open `slides/Introduction to RAG.pdf` for the presentation.

### **Run on Google Colab**
If you prefer not to set up a local environment, open the notebook in Google Colab:
[Run Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)

## Additional Notes
- You need to use GROQ API, you can get an API key from [GROQ's official website](https://console.groq.com/keys) and configure it in your environment.
- Modify the notebook as needed to experiment with different retrieval and generation approaches.
