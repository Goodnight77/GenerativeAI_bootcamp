# Intro to RAG Data Overflow

## Project Overview

This project provides an introduction to Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) through a Jupyter Notebook and accompanying slides.  It demonstrates a basic RAG data flow.

## Features

* **Jupyter Notebook (`basic_rag_dataflow.ipynb`):** A practical demonstration of a basic RAG data flow.
* **Presentation Slides (`slides/Introduction to RAG.pdf`):**  A presentation providing an overview of RAG concepts.

## Installation

This project utilizes Python.  To set up the environment and run the Jupyter Notebook, you'll need to install Python and any necessary packages.  While no specific environment files (like `environment.yml` or `requirements.txt`) are provided, you should ensure you have the necessary libraries installed for running Jupyter Notebooks and any libraries used within `basic_rag_dataflow.ipynb`.  This likely includes `pandas` and potentially others depending on the notebook's content.


**Step-by-step installation:**

1. **Install Python:**  If you don't already have Python installed, download and install it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
2. **Install Jupyter Notebook:** Open your terminal or command prompt and run: `pip install jupyter`
3. **Install necessary packages:** Inspect `basic_rag_dataflow.ipynb` to identify any imported libraries and install them using pip. For example, if the notebook uses langchain, run: `pip install pandas`


## Usage

1. **Navigate to the project directory:** Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the `Intro-RAG-Data-Overflow` directory.
2. **Start Jupyter Notebook:** Run the command `jupyter notebook`.  This will open Jupyter Notebook in your web browser.
3. **Open and run the notebook:** Open `basic_rag_dataflow.ipynb` and run the cells sequentially.
4. **View the slides:** Open `slides/Introduction to RAG.pdf` to view the presentation.
