# Generative AI Bootcamp

## Project Overview

This project contains materials for a Generative AI Bootcamp. It covers topics like:

* **Model Types & LLMs:** This project introduces different types of Generative AI models, with a focus on Large Language Models (LLMs).
* **NLP Pipeline:** This project guides through the building of a Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline.
* **NLP Preprocessing:** This project focuses on data preprocessing techniques for NLP tasks.

## Features

* **Jupyter Notebooks:**  The project includes Jupyter Notebooks demonstrating various concepts and practical implementations. 
    * `Model_types_LLMs.ipynb`: Covers an introduction to different Generative AI models and LLMs.
    * `NLP_pipeline.ipynb`:  Demonstrates building a complete NLP pipeline.
    * `nlp_preprocessing.ipynb`: Provides examples of data preprocessing techniques for NLP.
* **Supporting Documents:** Includes a Markdown file for additional content or information (`read1.md`).

## Installation

**1. Install Python and Required Packages**

This project is likely based on Python.  Install Python and create a virtual environment using your preferred method. Here's an example using `venv`:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
.venv\Scripts\activate   # On Windows
```

**2. Install Dependencies**

If this project uses a package manager (e.g., `pip`), install dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt  # Assuming a requirements.txt file is present
```

## Usage

**Run Jupyter Notebooks:**

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

This will open Jupyter Notebook in your browser. You can then navigate to the notebooks within the project directory and run them.

**Read Supporting Documents:**

You can open `read1.md` to find additional information or content.
