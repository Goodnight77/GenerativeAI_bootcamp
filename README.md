## NLP_workshop

### The workshops are designed to provide members with essential text preprocessing techniques for preparing datasets, particularly tweets, for sentiment analysis. Attendees will learn to leverage Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and NLTK to clean and transform raw text data effectively. The curriculum includes a comprehensive set of preprocessing steps, such as:
- Converting text to lowercase
- Removing HTML tags
- Removing URLs
- Removing punctuation
- Expanding chat words and abbreviations
- Removing emojis
- Correcting spelling using TextBlob and PySpellChecker libraries
- Removing stopwords using NLTK
By the end of the workshop, members will gain a thorough understanding of how to preprocess text data, equipping them to conduct sentiment analysis and other natural language processing tasks with improved accuracy and efficiency.
